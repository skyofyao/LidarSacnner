# Installing Dependencies

## GCC and Make
GCC and Make are required to compile the URG Network. On Debian based Linux distrbutions this can be installed with the following command.
`sudo apt-get install build-essential`

## URG Network (Version 1.2.0) flor Lidar
This project uses the URG Network for communicating and collecting data from Lidar. The URG library can be found at http://urgnetwork.sourceforge.net/html/index.html To install follow the instructions in the Readme file.

## FlyCapture SDK (Version 2.9.3.43)

# Compiling and Running

## Configuration
The network configuration for the motor and lidar is defined in src/main.cpp.

## Compiling
The program can be compiled by running `make`.

## Running the program
After the program is compiled, `./bin/pheno3v2` will run the program.

## Note:
1. If having trouble running "StartCapture()" for multiple cameras:
https://www.ptgrey.com/tan/10685
For ubuntu older than 14.04:
run "sudo modprobe usbcore usbfs_memory_mb=1000", then reboot.
// editing /media/boot/boot.ini and adding usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000 to bootargs toward the end.

For newer than or equal 14.04:
To set the maximum usbfs memory limit permanently:
1. Open the /etc/default/grub file in any text editor. Find and replace:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
with this:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000"
2. Update grub with these settings:
$ sudo update-grub
3. Reboot and test a USB 3.1 camera.
If this method fails to set the memory limit, run the following command:
$ sudo sh -c 'echo 1000 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'
To confirm that you have successfully updated the memory limit, run the following command:
cat /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb
